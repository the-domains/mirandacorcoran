### Digital Objects

We're a generation that grew up not just on but with the internet, witnessing its awkward adolescence just as it witnessed ours. We're always on, constantly connected, but we still remember our [pre-internet brains][0] (though we don't necessarily miss them).

We are the creators, curators, and consumers of vast quantities of digital content and the data that goes along with it. We know it's not only information, but ideas, aesthetics, sentiments, that spread voraciously across our increasingly decentralized and distributed networks; the way we access this material is no longer linear and our proximity to it is decreasingly tied to physical location.

Each minute, [72][1] hours of video are uploaded to Youtube and[23,300][1]hours of Skype conversations occur. While this kind of simultaneity is by no means an attribute exclusive to the digital age, today's tool-sets make us more aware of it than ever before. Everything we create: products, buildings, and the infrastructure behind them, exists as virtual artifacts before, during, and in some cases after its physical manifestation. We no longer naively conceive of a dichotomy of the "real" and the "virtual" but instead navigate a complex integration of digital and analogue presence.

Our technology moves with us --- in the most literal sense (supposedly we now carry [more processing power in our pockets than NASA had when it landed astronauts on the moon][2]) and we move with it too. Networked culture has shifted our relationship with space and time and dramatically reshaped our ideas of authority and authorship.

We place our trust in the shared knowledge of the crowd more so than singular expert opinions. In a time of copyleft and creative commons we value the remix as much --- if not moreso than the original.

Above all we expect access; we expect answers, information, and the media we choose at our fingertips in fractions of a second. The FCC ruling earlier this year to treat internet access as a public utility validated this. As millenials, Gen Y --- whatever you choose to call us --- we've created the start-up revolution. The results of one survey indicate that 54% of 18--34 year-olds want to start their own business. We're doing this not only because of a socio-economic climate that means we have to, but_because we can_. We have the platforms to be heard and to reach the right audiences. We see the ability to influence and be influenced as a basic right.

Networked culture has introduced an entirely new paradigm, altering settlement patterns, behaviours, and values to the same extent as the industrial revolution and the advent of agriculture before it. Our obsession with social media is not just a cry for attention; while it may in part result from a search for new archetypes in the face of dramatically altered and rapidly evolving realities, at the end of the day, it's about a capacity for shared experience. Today, even inactive consumption of media alters its trajectory.

Digital distribution and networked culture have prompted new ways of thinking and of being. The way we design and interact with most objects, has, in contrast remained remarkably static. We now have the tools (between generative/algorithmic modelling and the rapidly decreasing cost and increasing quality of additive manufacturing technologies) at our disposal to change this. We need new typologies and more dynamic frameworks for the way we make things.

We need to find ways of designing that invite augmentation and evolution, defining new processes for how we move from [bits to atoms][3] and back again.

This is not about focusing on designing "interfaces"; creating more options to select, adding to the constant bombardment of notifications we now face, or even about the internet of things. Instead, it's a matter of creating [things of the internet][4], designing_interactions_at the interstices of our digital and analogue lives.

These interactions should be seamless, they should be intuitive (what Andy Goodman recently termed [Zero UI][5]and what Negroponte was calling "[World as Interface][3]" back in '97 ), but they must also be open to change.

It's a matter of placing more trust in the user, in the expertise of the crowd; creating objects with the ability to respond to their context and the capacity to be remixed, extended, and reconfigured.

This is the shift towards multiplicity in place of universality as we move out of the era of Modernist mass-production and into a Post-Modern, Post-Internet era where distributed production has not only become possible but necessary in order to create tools capable of extending the way we now think and live.
